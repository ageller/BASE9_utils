# Code used to define input files for BASE-9 for a user-defined star cluster
 
The main codes are:
- `getGaiaData.py` : this is the primary worker code
- `makePhot.ipynb` : this is an example notebook that runs `getGaiaData.py` for a particular star cluster

Please see the `README.md` file in the root directory for further instructions.
